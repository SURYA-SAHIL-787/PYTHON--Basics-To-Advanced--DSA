📘 Conditional Statements (IF / ELIF / ELSE) — Complete Practice Roadmap

Contains a comprehensive set of 180 level-wise practice problems focused on mastering Python conditional statements using if, elif, and else.

Structured from Level 0 to Level 8, ensuring a smooth progression from beginner-level condition checks to advanced system-level decision logic.

Levels 0–1 cover fundamental concepts such as:

Positive/negative/zero checks

Even/odd logic

Basic comparisons

Simple validations using single if and if–else

Levels 2–3 focus on:

Nested if statements

Logical operators (and, or, not)

elif chains

Categorization problems like grading systems, slabs, and classifications

Levels 4–5 introduce real-world decision-making scenarios, including:

Billing systems (electricity, water, tax, discounts)

Eligibility checks (scholarship, loan, exam, age)

Input validation and boundary conditions

Optimization and simplification of complex conditions

Levels 6–7 are designed to develop software-engineering thinking, covering:

ATM and banking decision logic

Authentication and access control systems

Inventory and workflow state logic

Rule engines, fallback mechanisms, and priority handling

Level 8 (Mini Projects) consolidates all concepts through practical systems such as:

Grading and evaluation systems

Online shopping checkout logic

Ticket booking and billing systems

Rule-based decision engines and validation pipelines

Emphasizes:

Clear logical thinking

Handling edge cases correctly

Writing readable and maintainable conditional logic

Suitable for:

University semester exams

Coding interviews

Beginners to advanced learners

Building strong problem-solving foundations in Python
