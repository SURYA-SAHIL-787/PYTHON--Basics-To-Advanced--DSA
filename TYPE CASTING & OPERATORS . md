TOPIC 3 — TYPE CASTING & OPERATORS
WHAT IS TYPE CASTING ?

TYPE CASTING IS THE PROCESS OF CONVERTING ONE DATA TYPE INTO ANOTHER.
TYPE CASTING IS REQUIRED WHEN DIFFERENT DATA TYPES ARE USED TOGETHER.
PYTHON PROVIDES BUILT-IN MECHANISMS FOR TYPE CONVERSION.
TYPE CASTING CAN BE EXPLICIT OR IMPLICIT.

WHY TYPE CASTING IS IMPORTANT

USER INPUT IS ALWAYS READ AS STRING.
MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS REQUIRE NUMERIC TYPES.
TYPE CASTING PREVENTS TYPE ERRORS.
PROPER CASTING ENSURES CORRECT CALCULATIONS AND OUTPUT.

============================================================
LEVEL 0 — BASIC TYPE CONVERSIONS
NUMERIC CONVERSIONS

INTEGERS CAN BE CONVERTED TO FLOATS FOR DECIMAL PRECISION.
FLOATS CAN BE CONVERTED TO INTEGERS BY REMOVING DECIMAL PART.
NUMERIC STRINGS CAN BE CONVERTED INTO NUMBERS.

STRING CONVERSIONS

NUMBERS CAN BE CONVERTED INTO STRINGS FOR DISPLAY PURPOSES.
STRING CONVERSION IS NECESSARY FOR CONCATENATION.

BOOLEAN CONVERSIONS

BOOLEAN TRUE CONVERTS TO NUMERIC ONE.
BOOLEAN FALSE CONVERTS TO NUMERIC ZERO.
ZERO VALUES ARE CONSIDERED FALSE IN BOOLEAN CONTEXT.
NON-ZERO VALUES ARE CONSIDERED TRUE.
EMPTY STRINGS AND EMPTY COLLECTIONS ARE FALSE.
NON-EMPTY STRINGS AND COLLECTIONS ARE TRUE.

TYPE INSPECTION

TYPE CAN BE CHECKED BEFORE AND AFTER CONVERSION.
TYPE INSPECTION HELPS VERIFY CORRECT CONVERSION.

INPUT CONVERSIONS

INPUT DATA MUST BE CONVERTED BEFORE PROCESSING.
STRING INPUT CAN BE CONVERTED TO INTEGER OR FLOAT.
NUMERIC DATA CAN BE CONVERTED BACK TO STRING FOR OUTPUT.

============================================================
LEVEL 1 — BASIC OPERATORS
ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS PERFORM MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS.
ADDITION COMBINES VALUES.
SUBTRACTION FINDS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VALUES.
MULTIPLICATION PRODUCES PRODUCT.
DIVISION PRODUCES QUOTIENT.
FLOOR DIVISION RETURNS INTEGER RESULT.
MODULUS RETURNS REMAINDER.
POWER OPERATOR CALCULATES EXPONENTIATION.
ARITHMETIC RESULTS CAN BE STORED IN VARIABLES.

COMPARISON OPERATORS

COMPARISON OPERATORS COMPARE TWO VALUES.
EQUALITY CHECKS IF VALUES ARE SAME.
INEQUALITY CHECKS IF VALUES ARE DIFFERENT.
GREATER AND LESS OPERATORS COMPARE MAGNITUDE.
COMPARISON RESULTS ARE ALWAYS BOOLEAN.
STRINGS ARE COMPARED LEXICOGRAPHICALLY.

============================================================
LEVEL 2 — INPUT + CASTING + OPERATORS

INPUT VALUES CAN BE CAST BEFORE OPERATIONS.
CASTING ENSURES OPERATORS WORK CORRECTLY.
NUMERIC STRINGS MUST BE CONVERTED BEFORE ADDITION.
MIXED TYPE OPERATIONS REQUIRE CAREFUL CASTING.
COMPARISONS SHOULD BE DONE AFTER TYPE CONVERSION.
RESULTS CAN BE STORED, CONVERTED, AND DISPLAYED.
TYPE CASTING HELPS AVOID RUNTIME ERRORS.

============================================================
LEVEL 3 — OPERATOR PRECEDENCE & EXPRESSIONS
OPERATOR PRECEDENCE

OPERATOR PRECEDENCE DEFINES EXECUTION ORDER.
MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION EXECUTE BEFORE ADDITION.
PARENTHESES OVERRIDE DEFAULT PRECEDENCE.

EXPRESSION EVALUATION

EXPRESSIONS CAN CONTAIN MULTIPLE OPERATORS.
RESULTS DEPEND ON PRECEDENCE RULES.
COMPLEX EXPRESSIONS SHOULD BE BROKEN INTO STEPS.
EXPRESSION RESULTS CAN BE STORED IN VARIABLES.
FLOAT PRECISION ISSUES CAN OCCUR IN CALCULATIONS.

EXPRESSION COMPARISON

MULTIPLE EXPRESSIONS CAN BE COMPARED.
STEP-BY-STEP EVALUATION IMPROVES CLARITY.

============================================================
LEVEL 4 — LOGICAL OPERATORS & BOOLEAN THINKING
LOGICAL OPERATORS

LOGICAL OPERATORS COMBINE CONDITIONS.
AND OPERATOR REQUIRES ALL CONDITIONS TRUE.
OR OPERATOR REQUIRES AT LEAST ONE TRUE CONDITION.
NOT OPERATOR INVERTS BOOLEAN VALUE.

BOOLEAN THINKING

LOGICAL OPERATORS WORK WITH NUMBERS, STRINGS, AND BOOLEAN VALUES.
LOGICAL RESULTS CAN BE STORED IN VARIABLES.
COMPLEX CONDITIONS CAN BE SIMPLIFIED USING LOGIC.

REAL-WORLD LOGIC

LOGICAL OPERATORS ARE USED FOR ELIGIBILITY CHECKS.
MULTIPLE CONDITIONS CAN BE VALIDATED TOGETHER.
VALIDATION RESULTS CONTROL PROGRAM FLOW.

============================================================
LEVEL 5 — ASSIGNMENT & BITWISE OPERATORS
ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS

ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS UPDATE VARIABLE VALUES.
COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT REDUCES CODE LENGTH.
VALUES CHANGE STEP-BY-STEP USING ASSIGNMENT.
INCORRECT ASSIGNMENT CAN CAUSE LOGIC ERRORS.

BITWISE OPERATORS

BITWISE OPERATORS WORK AT BINARY LEVEL.
AND, OR, XOR, AND NOT OPERATE ON BITS.
SHIFT OPERATORS MOVE BITS LEFT OR RIGHT.
BITWISE OPERATIONS ARE USED IN LOW-LEVEL PROGRAMMING.

============================================================
LEVEL 6 — IDENTITY, MEMBERSHIP & TYPE SAFETY
IDENTITY OPERATORS

IDENTITY OPERATORS CHECK MEMORY REFERENCE.
IS CHECKS IF TWO VARIABLES REFER TO SAME OBJECT.
EQUALITY CHECKS VALUE, NOT IDENTITY.
MUTABILITY AFFECTS IDENTITY BEHAVIOR.

MEMBERSHIP OPERATORS

MEMBERSHIP OPERATORS CHECK PRESENCE OF VALUE.
IN CHECKS EXISTENCE IN COLLECTION.
NOT IN CHECKS ABSENCE IN COLLECTION.
MEMBERSHIP IS USED FOR VALIDATION AND FILTERING.

============================================================
LEVEL 7 — ROBUST CASTING & ERROR AVOIDANCE

INVALID CONVERSIONS CAN CAUSE ERRORS.
ERROR HANDLING PREVENTS PROGRAM CRASH.
INPUT SHOULD BE VALIDATED BEFORE CASTING.
DIVISION BY ZERO MUST BE HANDLED SAFELY.
FLAGS CAN TRACK ERRORS AND FAILURES.
SAFE SYSTEMS EXIT GRACEFULLY AFTER ERRORS.

============================================================
LEVEL 8 — REAL-WORLD MINI SYSTEMS

OPERATORS POWER REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS.
LOGICAL OPERATORS DRIVE DECISION SYSTEMS.
COMPARISONS CONTROL RULE ENGINES.
BOOLEAN FLAGS CONTROL APPLICATION FLOW.
TYPE CASTING ENSURES SAFE DATA PROCESSING.

============================================================
LEVEL 9 — ADVANCED THINKING

OPERATOR PRECEDENCE MUST BE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD.
FLOAT COMPARISON REQUIRES TOLERANCE.
TYPE SAFETY PREVENTS UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR.
REUSABLE OPERATOR UTILITIES IMPROVE DESIGN.
ADVANCED SYSTEMS REQUIRE CAREFUL EXPRESSION HANDLING.
