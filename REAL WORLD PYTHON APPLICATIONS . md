If you want “every area” in one line:

Python is used wherever people need automation + data + APIs + AI + scripting + analysis.

To use Python in all these fields 

Core Python + OOP (strong basics)

Data handling: Pandas + SQL basics

Web: FastAPI basics + JSON + REST

Automation: file handling, web automation

AI/ML basics: scikit-learn → PyTorch later

Deployment basics: Docker + cloud fundamentals
